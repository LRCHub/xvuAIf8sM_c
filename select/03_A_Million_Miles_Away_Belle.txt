Light glimmers in a flower
Like jewels in a dream
The sky breathes life, love to everything

At times I've thought I'm not enough
The chains that tie my heart
But there's still a path that lies ahead for you and I

Memories fade away
Clouds of yesterday
With no one to love
Is this life worth living?

Come back to me and stay by my side
I feel my heart shake
Come, ease this ache

I'm standing over here, reaching for you
A million miles away, come back and stay
No matter how far the memories may be
When I close my eyes, you're all that I see
Come back to me
A million miles away, come back and stay

La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la
(La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la)
(La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la)
(La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la)

Sing, let your heart soar, sing forever
Sad and so happy, feelings flow over, now
Our world is full of all kinds of colors
Closing my eyes I still can see the stars
Shine in the sky, sing their harmony
Flowers they're blooming, oh, it's beautiful

Sing, sing, sing
Sing this song, I won't stop now
Sing it through, I love you
The voice carries on
